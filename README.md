### qre-testcases

Intended to be an example for how to manage and organize tests.

## To-Do:
1. Structure Test Folder, Test Cases, and Steps
2. Branching strategy for review and approval
    - master
    - release (needs to be re-worded eg. for approval)
    - hotfixes (re-worded to reflex emergency tests added to current release after approval)
3. Tagging Strategy (assuming group by release date)
